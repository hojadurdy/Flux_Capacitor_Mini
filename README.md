# Flux Capacitor Mini

### What is it?
A miniature version of Flux Capacitor from the movie trilogy Back to the Future. Measuring at only 48mm x 38mm (1.89in x 1.5in), it can be easily pocketable . It is constructed with high quality 3D printed frame sandwiched between stacked Gold Plated PCBs. Featuring 24 LEDs diffused through bare FR4 material, that animate to create the “fluxxing” effect. It’s 100% decorative, it doesn’t actually let you travel through time.

This mini Flux Capacitor is controlled by a Microchip ATtiny816 microcontroller. By using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins for 8 channels of 3 paralleled LEDs, different animation patterns are generated for the fluxxxing effect. In settings mode, users are able change the animation type, speed, and LED brightness. There are 8 animations, 4 animation speeds, 4 LED brightness levels (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%).

### Power Requirements
Device requires 1.21 Gigawatts ("Jigowatts") of power, that is generated by a small nuclear reactor named LIR2032 that needs to be placed inside, which also encapsulates a small pellet of Plutonium, to be used as fuel for the reactor (Ok, joke aside this sentence is totally not true). To really power it you only need a non-rechargeable CR2032 or rechargeable LIR2032 coin cell battery.

### How long will the battery last?
Power consumption is drastically lowered. At full brightness it draws 3.7mA and at 25% brightness it draws 1.8mA of current from the battery. 

CR2032 (Non-Rechargeable) with average of 210mAh battery capacity.

- 100% LED Brightness :  57 Hours
- 25%  LED Brightness :  110 Hours

LIR2032 (Rechargeable) with average of 40mAh battery capacity.

- 100% LED Brightness :  11 Hours
- 25%  LED Brightness :  21 Hours

### What is included with your purchase?
- 1x Front Panel. 3 Stacked PCB, with 24 LEDs and All the Electronics Soldered on
- 1x 3D Printed Frame of Your Selection
- 4x M2.5x4mm Screws
- 1x Back Cover PCB
